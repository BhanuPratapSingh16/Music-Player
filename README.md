ðŸŽµ Music Player

Hello everyone!
Iâ€™ve built a fully functional Music Player from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates how to combine front-end web technologies to create an interactive, visually appealing, and responsive audio player â€” all without any external frameworks.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Play / Pause music
âœ… Next and Previous track controls
âœ… Dynamic song list display
âœ… Custom progress bar (seek bar)
âœ… Play time and duration tracking
âœ… Modern, minimal, and responsive UI
âœ… Built completely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS

ðŸ§  Technologies Used

HTML5 â€“ for structure

CSS3 â€“ for styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) â€“ for logic and interactivity

Google Fonts â€“ for clean and modern typography

Font Awesome â€“ for control icons (play, pause, etc.)
